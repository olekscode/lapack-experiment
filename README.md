# pharo-ai Lapack experiment

## Requirements

- Have installed `python3`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas` and `Pharo11` on your computer.
- Have LAPACK installed on your computer
- Have around 7GB of free memory space in the hard drive for the datasets.

## Generating the datasets

To generate the datasets, you need to run the file `DatasetGenerator.py` using `python3`.

```
python3 DatasetGenerator.py
```

This step can take until 15 minutes because the datasets can be big.

The script will generate the three datasets (small, medium and large) into the `data` directory.
Note that the datasets are generated using a random seed. So you always have exactly the same datasets.

## Running the Python benchmarks

To run the Python benchmarks, you need to execute the file `PythonExperiment.py` using `python3`.

The script will run the benchmarks and create a csv file with the results in the directory `./experiment-results/python-results.csv`

## Running the Pharo benchmarks

First, you need to download the Pharo launcher from the Pharo website https://pharo.org/download. Then, create a Pharo 11 image.

For importing the code into the Pharo image you need to use iceberg:

- Open iceberg
- Click on the right corner button "Add +"
- Select "Import from existing clone" option
- Then select the directory of where did you cloned the repo. Note that you must have already the datasets generated to be able to run the code
- Finnally, in the initial window of Iceberg, select the repository in the list "lapack-experiment", then right click - Metacello - Install baseline of AILapackExperiment (Default)

Finally, you need execute in a Playground

```st
PharoExperiment new runExperiment
```

The script runs the benchmarks and opens a text presenter with the results.
